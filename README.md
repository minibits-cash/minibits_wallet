# Disclaimer

⚠️ If you are using this app, please take the following into consideration:
- This wallet should be used for research purposes only.
- The wallet is a beta version with incomplete functionality and both known and unknown bugs.
- Do not use it with large amounts of ecash.
- The ecash stored in the wallet is issued by the mint. You trust the mint to back it with bitcoin until you transfer your holdings to another bitcoin Lightning wallet.
- The Cashu protocol that the wallet implements has not yet received extensive review or testing so far.

## Architecture

The wallet's design has been crafted to prioritize the following primary quality properties:
- Support both Android and iOS mobile platforms
- Achieve fast startup time and UX (despite using React Native)
- Minimize the risk of data/ecash loss
- Bring e-cash UX on par with the current standard of traditional finance (tradfi) mobile apps

As a result, the following architectural constraints are in place:
- Wherever available, use libraries with a fast JSI (JavaScript Interface) to native modules.
- Avoid Expo modules.
- Use fastest available storage for most wallet operations and separate local database storage to store data that incrementally grows.
- Leverage local database as an append-only ecash backup independent from fast storage.

Open architectural concepts that were still open for discussion when the wallet had been released
- [x] Contacts management - identities, sharing contacts, send ecash with the UX of tradfi instant payment while keeping privacy towards mints - Implemented as NOSTR keypairs and NIP05 public sharable names that ecash can be sent to
- [x] Off-device backup strategy - Implemented using @gandlafbtc concept of deterministic secrets
- [ ] UX and naming conventions - ecash is not always intuitive. UX for new users heavily depends on using the right abstractions or terms to describe what is going on. This wallet wants to serve as a means to test what could work. One of the first ideas is to avoid terms such as token or proof and propose the term --coin ++ecash instead.
- [ ] Suitable Tor daemon available to replace not maintained react-native-tor.

# Development

Minibits is a bare React Native app written in Typescript. The project structure and code itself are intentionally verbose to support readability. Critical wallet code is reasonably documented. However, there is vast space for existing code improvements, refactoring, and bug fixing. This is an early beta software and the author does not code for a living.

The code is derived from Ignite template, however with many libraries, notably Expo, stripped down to achieve fast startup times. Performance bottleneck on some Android devices is react-native-keychain. To overcome this, it has been patched not to warm-up on startup, caching for wallet operatoions is in place and its use to encrypt storage is opt-in.

Wallet state is managed by mobx-state-tree and persisted in fast MMKV storage. Only the basic mobx concepts are in place, whole model could be improved. All critical wallet code is in services/walletService.ts and all ecash state changes are in models/ProofsStore.ts. Wallet communication with the mints is in services/cashuMintClient.ts and uses [cashu-ts](https://github.com/cashubtc/cashu-ts) library.

Crypto operations are handled by react-native-quick-crypto, that is fast and does not require awful javascript shims. Transaction history and ecash backup is stored in sqlite, with fast react-native-quick-sqlite driver that enables to run lighter queries synchronously.

Wallet included own Tor daemon using react-native-tor library to connect to the mints over Tor network. However this seems not to be long term approach as this library is
not properly maintained and future updates of React native will likely break it. Help with replacement would be appreciated.

In case of breaking state and data model changes, versioning and code is ready to run necessary migrations on wallet startup.

# Running in development mode

To run Minibits wallet in dev mode, set up the React Native development environment and the Yarn package manager. Then clone this repository, navigate to the minibits_wallet directory, and run the following:

```bash
yarn install
```

There are post-install patches to some of the libraries that should run automatically and are necessary for a successful run. See the patches directory for more info.
After the dependecies are installed, continue to create the following .env file in the root folder:

```bash
APP_ENV = 'DEV'
LOG_LEVEL='DEBUG'
```

Then make sure you have the Android device connected by running:

```bash
yarn adb
```

Finally run this and pray:

```bash
yarn start
```

In case of issues, repo includes commits history from the out of the box react native app up until the complete wallet. You can see build.gradle and other changes one by one and hopefully figure out what's wrong.

# Building

Create debug .apk:

```bash
yarn android:dev
```

# Automated testing

The app has the scaffolding for automated tests; they are yet to be implemented. For functional bugs or suggestions please raise an issue.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, just start and we will figure out what's next.
